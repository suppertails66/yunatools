NOTE: while 恒星系 for ""star systems"" would make sense, i just don't hear a 系 in there. it sounds like it's only こうせい, though i'm not sure what to make of that... 恒星 (""fixed star, i.e. not a planet"") by itself doesn't make sense here, and while there are approximately a billion homophones for こうせい, none of them really make much more sense. 行星 as ""planet"" would work, but the dictionary also says it's an obsolete term... or 後生 for ""young people"", maybe?? that doesn't seem right either... ugh. i'll just go with ""planets"" because yuna is representing earth, which would imply one contestant per planet, i.e. potentially more than one per star system? we know lia is from mars, and i assume she was also in the contest, which would support that theory...
...you know, i think maybe i'm starting to take this game a little too seriously.
